Students work in teams to refine the "Weight" experiment in the Playground app:

1. They change the dashboard text for a gauge (alarm clock) and set up a traffic light for 3 weight ranges
2. They add more students to the flow
3. Set up a "weight calibration" function (bubble function) that will take 5 kg off
