## Import Node-RED notification flow

### Step 1: Copy the text below to the clipboard:

```text
[{"id":"5ca15197.aef91","type":"mqtt in","z":"49c6b66c.16eaf8","name":"","topic":"node/door-sensor:0/door-sensor/a/state","qos":"2","broker":"67b8de4a.029d3","x":210,"y":100,"wires":[["ccd36bb4.eccae8"]]},{"id":"ccd36bb4.eccae8","type":"switch","z":"49c6b66c.16eaf8","name":"","property":"payload","propertyType":"msg","rules":[{"t":"eq","v":"false","vt":"str"}],"checkall":"true","repair":false,"outputs":1,"x":210,"y":220,"wires":[["6cb9da01.6abab4"]]},{"id":"6cb9da01.6abab4","type":"ifttt out","z":"49c6b66c.16eaf8","eventName":"door","key":"","x":210,"y":320,"wires":[]},{"id":"67b8de4a.029d3","type":"mqtt-broker","z":"","broker":"127.0.0.1","port":"1883","clientid":"","usetls":false,"compatmode":true,"keepalive":"60","cleansession":true,"birthTopic":"","birthQos":"0","birthPayload":"","willTopic":"","willQos":"0","willPayload":""}]
```

### Step 2: Click on the top right **menu**, then select **Import** and **Clipboard:**

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-menu-import.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

### **Step 3:** Paste the text from clipboard to the textbox and press **Import:**

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-dialog-import.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

## Set IFTTT key

### **Step 1:** You have imported the flow. Now you need to fill in your own **IFTTT key**. Double click on the **IFTTT** node:

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-doubleclick-ifttt.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Click on a **pencil symbol** and copy and **paste the key** from the last step of IFTTT integration chapter. Check that the **Event name** is set to the **door** event. Then click **Done:**

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-config-ifttt.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

## Run and test your flow!

### **Step 1:** Everytime you change the flow, you have to click on the **Deploy** button in the right top corner. **Please do that now:**

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-deploy.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

### **Step 2:** Now put the magnet near the magnetic sensor and away on your Radio Door Sensor. You should get IFTTT notification in a few seconds later!

You should see "true" and "false" messages in the right **debug** tab and during **false** there will be a **Sent!** green flag near the IFTTT node for a while.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_node-red-test.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

If you would like be notified on "true" messages instead of **false**, just open the **switch node** and change the `false` text in the rules to `true`.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./img/radio-door-sensor/radio-door-sensor_phone-notification.webp')}/>
  </div>
</div>

:success

Now find the right spot for the **Radio Door Sensor** and enjoy the notifications you get!
