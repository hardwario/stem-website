## Experiment 1 - Indoor Air Quality Monitor

**Time allocation:** 15 mins. 

### Experiment Description

The HARDWARIO kit will be used to build the indoor climate quality monitor. The device allows us to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), the concentration of organic volatile substances (VOC), temperature and relative humidity. Communication will be carried out wirelessly to Radio Dongle plugged into the USB port of the computer. The measured data will be displayed in the HARDWARIO Playground application, resp. in the embedded Node-RED dashboard.

In the experiment, we will understand:

* that warm air is rising and why
* what is the relative humidity and dew point
* that the standard outdoor CO2 concentration is 400 ppm, 0.04% and that in an unventilated room to increase and at higher concentrations negatively affect our performance
* that CO2 is heavier than air
* that VOCs are volatile organic compounds, measured in ppb and the acceptable TVOC concentration (VOC total) is 500 ppb (0.00005%)

### Experiment Steps

1. The building of the monitoring unit 
2. Playground application installation
3. Connecting unit to Playground
4. The setting of monitoring and data display functions
5. Measurement of temperature, humidity, CO2 and VOC

```

* Press **Deploy**
* Switch to the **Messages** tab, if everything went well, you should see the incoming messages from the unit
* Switch to the **Dashboard** tab, if everything went well, you should see the gauges with the current temperature, humidity, CO2 and VOC readings.  
  *Notes:*  
*1. Breathe warm air to speed up the sending of data to the unit*  
*2. It may take a while to display the results of CO2 and VOC measurements, be patient :)*

### Measuring of temperature, humidity,  CO2 and VOC


* Compete in teams who generate the highest temperature with their breath
Question for the team with the lowest temperature 
**Why does the warm air rise up?**
* Compare the measured humidity between teams
A question for all teams  
**The measured humidity is relative humidity. Explain the terms of relative humidity and dew point.**
* Compare the measured CO2 and VOC concentrations between the teams CO2 and VOC
A question for all teams 
**How do you explain the differences in the measured values?**

## Experiment 2 - Air Quality Monitor Integration with the Google Sheet

**Time allocation:** 15 mins. 

### Experiment Description

Experiment 1 can be followed by integration with the Google Sheet. The measured data from the indoor air quality monitor will be stored in a table from which we will create well-arranged graphs.

In the experiment, we will understand:

* how to connect Google Sheet spreadsheet with Playground
* how to create well-arranged graphs showing the dependence of measured values with the timetable and number of students in the classroom

### Experiment Steps

* Create a **Google account**
* Create a new Google sheet, eg. via [sheets.new](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeiJCh4L6f6cXWA7HfXrqGrWJPnjWcaemCiTn-Mbf9M/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
* Rename your current List from **List1 to Data**, we will refere to that in the code later
* You can also change first line to say what values are on the columns, it will arrive in this order **CO2, Temperature, Humidity, TVOC**.
* On the **Tools** tab select **Script editor**

* Paste the **script** below and save it with **Ctrl + S**

```json
function doPost(e) {
  var sheet;
  var rawData = e.parameter.val; // Data arrives in format "CO2;temp;hum;TVOC"
  sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Data");

  var cuttedData = rawData.split(";"); //This cuts arrived data into separated values
  sheet.appendRow([cuttedData[0], cuttedData[1], cuttedData[2], cuttedData[3], new Date()]); //Data arrives in this order: "CO2, Temperature, Humidity, TVOC"
}
```


* **Name the project** by your team name and press **OK**
* On the **Publish** tab, select **Deploy as web app**
* In the authorization settings, for **Who has access to the app**, select **Anyone, even anonymous**, and then press **Deploy**
* Press the **Review Permission button**. A window will pop up that the application is not verified. Select **Advanced** and **Go to `<your project name>` (unsafe)**. Allow your project to access your Google Account by pressing the **Allow** button.

* Use **Ctrl + C** to copy the displayed **URL** for further use and press **OK**.

* In the **Playground** app, go to the Functions tab and import this **flow**

</div>


* In the flow, click the **http request** bubble and paste your project URL into the **URL field** and add the following **snipet**, then press **Done**
* The upper part with the **-1 node** is just to set default values in case some of the sensors didn't send any data yet.

```json
?value={{{payload}}}
```

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <Image img={require('./stem-experiment-code.png')}/>
  </div>
</div>


* Confirm the Functions setting by pressing the **Deploy** button
* Look at your **Google sheet project** and you should see how the measured values increase in each tab
* If you see **-1** in some column it means that the sensor didn't send any data yet.
* At the end of the measurement, complete the worksheets by specifying the timetable and number of pupils and then present the results to others.
