**Time allocation**: 2H Module: 15 mins. 4H Module: 45 mins. 8H Module: 3 x 45 mins.  
**Keywords**: #HARDWARIO #Project #Team_work #Ideation #Brainstorming

You will work in teams under the supervision of a lecturer on your own projects related to the topic of the lesson. Projects are commissioned in order to build on experiments and to discover new applications and expand your knowledge and skills.

In the case of the 2H module, we will replace the work on our own projects with Ideation, in which you will propose a real use of the knowledge gained by theoretical explanation and experiments. We write down the ideas in the graph, where on the x-axis you estimate the effort (cost) of the project and on the y-axis the impact of the solution.

## Tips for projects in the Apply phase

* Integration with Grafana
* Integration with Google Assistant
* Integration with Alexa

## Project Assignment for Apply phase: Integration with LED strip and Power Module

### Project Description

The project deals with integration with another module of the kit - Power Module and visual notification of CO2 concentration on the connected LED strip.

## Project Assignment for Apply phase: Playgroundu replacement for the Python script

### Project Description

The project deals with Node-RED flow replacement for Python script. Here is a sample code that will provide visual notification of the exceeded CO2 concentration on the attached LED strip.

## Project Assignment for Apply phase: Modeling and printing the enclosure on a 3D printer

### Project Description

In this experiment, we print the enclosure used in the CO2 monitor on a 3D printer. STL models can be found here:
