The goal of the IoT Soil Monitor lesson is to introduce soil monitoring, especially soil moisture, in one lesson. In the lesson, students will learn the definition of drought, soil water potential and how to measure soil moisture. 

Students will build their own soil capacitance sensor, create graphs of the measured values and a system of colour-coded indications of exceeding the set limits of soil moisture and temperature.
